## üëã Hello there, I'm Mahhin!
![Creative Art](images/Creative art img.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a 5th semester Computer Science student, eagerly looking to step into the professional world as a Junior Data Analyst. My journey so far has been a blend of academic learning and hands-on experience in data analysis.

üìä My passion lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I've had the opportunity to perform data analysis tasks as part of side jobs in my previous work. This hands-on experience has solidified my love for the field and sharpened my skills.

üîÑ While I'm capable of handling a variety of tasks, I excel in data transformations. Whether it's cleaning, transforming, or preparing data for further use, I find immense satisfaction in making data usable and insightful.

üåü I'm excited to connect with professionals and opportunities in the data analytics realm. Let's transform data together and make impactful decisions!

- Over the past 8 months, I have created multiple data projects, both self-initiated and paid, to hone my skills and gain practical experience.
- Utilized Python to analyze 7000 data science job listings and gain insights on what it takes to land a job in analytics.
- Implemented Regex techniques to comb through the job descriptions and identified the key requirements.
- Aggregated and visualized the data using pandas, matplotlib, and wordcloud to compile a professional report.
- Recently, I worked on an NLP project that involved using Regex and NLP techniques to prepare data for modeling, enhancing data quality and consistency.

### My Journey So Far

I have worked in multiple corporate companies in the past, taking on roles that ranged from sales to support. This diverse experience has given me a unique perspective and a versatile skill set.
