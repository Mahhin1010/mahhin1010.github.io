## üëã Hello there, I'm Mahhin! 

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a 5th semester Computer Science student, eagerly looking to step into the professional world as a Junior Data Analyst. My journey so far has been a blend of academic learning and hands-on experience in data analysis.

üìä My passion lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I've had the opportunity to perform data analysis tasks as part of side jobs in my previous work. This hands-on experience has solidified my love for the field and sharpened my skills.

üîÑ While I'm capable of handling a variety of tasks, I excel in data transformations. Whether it's cleaning, transforming, or preparing data for further use, I find immense satisfaction in making data usable and insightful.

üåü I'm excited to connect with professionals and opportunities in the data analytics realm. Let's transform data together and make impactful decisions!
